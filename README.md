# **Car Classification On Mobile Devices With Tensorflow 2.0**

This is a submission of **[Nguyen Duc Phuong](mailto:nguyenducphuong@cfvg.org)** for the [Grab AI For Sea Challenge:](https://www.aiforsea.com/)

**Computer Vision Challenge:**  Automatically recognize car model and make using the following dsitinct car images from the [Cars Datasets](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)

The notebook **Car Classifier.ipynb** implement the **Car Classifier** with step-by-step instructions. At the end, the trained model is saved and converted into Tensorflow Lite format, using the notebook **[Convert Tensorflow Lite.ipynb](https://github.com/nguyenducphuong1978/CarClassifier/blob/master/Convert_Tensorflow_Lite.ipynb)** and then being used in an example Android application. The code of the mobile example app is derived from the [Tensorflow Lite example](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android).
